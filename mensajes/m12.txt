Hello, How are you doing today? This is Barnes Beckwith. I saw your contact at 
the University of California, Berkeley, Department of East Asian Languages and 
Literatures under the Directory's portal. I seek a private beginner's language 
tutor for my Daughter. I would like to know if you have a STUDENT/TUTOR 
available for the job. As you will be unable to teach her owing to your BUSY 
SCHEDULE/STATUS, you can RECOMMEND one of your STUDENT(s) who is capable of 
teaching. Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, the teaching could be done remotely. 
This depends on the tutor's directive. Looking forward to hearing from you.
